Missing logos can be added via pull requests.

The pull request should contain 3 files:

* A `.svg` in the `SVG` directory (*with fonts converted to outlines*).
* A `.png` in the `PNG` directory (with dimensions 2521 x 2911).
* A `.png` in the `thumbs` directory (with dimensions 218 x 252).

Each of these files should be named with the package name and should not have 
any margins.
